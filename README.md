# Poetry with Vercel
## Vercel.com
Vercel is a cloud platform designed to streamline the deployment and scaling of websites and web applications. 
It adopts a serverless approach, relieving developers from the complexities of managing servers and infrastructure. 
While it's renowned for its support of frontend frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Next.js. 
Vercel also facilitates the deployment of serverless functions written in **Python**. This versatility allows 
developers to create full-stack applications, utilizing **Python* for backend logic alongside frontend frameworks, 
all hosted and managed seamlessly on Vercel's infrastructure.

## Python
To deploy a **Python** project on Vercel, ensure your codebase contains all necessary Python files with your application's logic, 
along with a `requirements.txt` listing dependencies. Include any configuration files, 
such as environment settings or other project-specific configurations. Optionally, include static assets like images 
or stylesheets, and serverless functions if your project utilizes them. With these components in place, 
Vercel can seamlessly deploy your Python project, handling dependencies and serving static assets as needed.

## Poetry
**Poetry** is a dependency management and packaging tool for **Python**. It simplifies the process of managing project dependencies by providing a user-friendly interface for dependency declaration, installation, and version management. With **Poetry**, you can define project dependencies in a `pyproject.toml` file, similar to other dependency management tools like `requirements.txt`, but with added features such as specifying package versions and dependencies. **Poetry** also includes commands for creating and managing virtual environments, building and publishing packages, and more, making it a comprehensive solution for **Python** project management and packaging.
